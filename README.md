# Pathfinding-visualiser
This program implements the A* path finding algorithm in Python. It finds/visualises the shortest path between 2 nodes in a randomly generated maze.
The program uses pygame for the animation and visualisation.


Here is an example of the output:

The blue squares represent the nodes, cyan represents the path, green represents the squares the cost is calculated for and the red squares represent the cumulative lowest cost over all the generations.
